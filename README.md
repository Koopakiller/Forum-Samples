# Forum-Samples

This repository contains some of my forum samples. I write very often small applications to test some circumstance from questions in the MSDN forum and from other places in the internet. The most applications are done after less than 10 lines of code, but sometimes I like my new written stuff and want to publish it. I think the code reach more people here on GitHub, than in the German MSDN Forum.
